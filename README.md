# rust tic-tac-toe
![Screenshot](./img/screenshot.png)
## DISCLAMER
I just started learning rust so the code should not be used as a example of 
good practice. This is is my first rust project, so if you have any suggestions
on how to improve the code feel free to write an issue. Maybe one day this code 
will become a showcase.

## Updates
- Added AI player which plays super defensive and is unbeatable. It will either Draw the game or Win by abusing your mistakes. 

## Install
